# Healthcare Project

This project involves a basic HTML page for collecting patient information, saving the data in XML format, and a Java program to parse the XML file and display the entered data in an HTML table.

## Instructions

### Running the HTML Page:

1. Open `healthcare.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter patient information in the form.
3. Click "Save Data and Display Table".
4. Patient data will be saved as `patient_data.xml` and displayed below.

### Running the Java Code:

1. Compile `ParseXML.java` using the command: `javac ParseXML.java`
2. Run the compiled class using the command: `java ParseXML`
3. Open `patient_table.html` to view the patient data table.

The project enables you to capture patient data through a user-friendly form, save it as XML, and use Java to parse the XML file and present the data in a structured HTML table.
